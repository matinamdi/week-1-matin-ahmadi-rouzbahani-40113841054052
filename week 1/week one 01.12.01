Exercises for season 3
Answer 1
Yes, all expressions have value and word 4 is one of them.
 The value of a variable named x stored in the memory location is limited to x.
Answer 2
 yes it is variable a validpython expression for examples of valid python identifievs incude:
X.X2.total.port_22

Answer 3
 No, because the subtotal is not considered a valid expression in Python
Answer4
What affect does the unary + operator have when applied to a numeric expression?
* .وقتی این عملگر بین عبارات عددی قرار میگیرد آنها را با یکدیگر جمع میکند
* When this operator is placed between expressions, it adds them together.

Answer 10
The sign (#) is the beginning of a comment
Answer 11
the comment ends after going to the top of the line, and for each line we leave a comment, we must put
# first, and the usual way is to put #, and for more than one comment line, you can use STR, but it
cannot be used in variable format.
Answer 12
None, neither too long nor too short; in fact, it should be concise, useful and understandable
Answer 13
For special situations that we feel need to be explained, we use comments to make notes for ourselves
because this part is not implemented in the code.
Answer 14
because the system does not understand and does not know anything except zero and one, and it is the
human or the user who must understand the content.
Answer 15
of the first error, there are various reasons, such as using the name of a variable or function that is not
defined, or spelling mistakes in the name of the variable or function, or using the Python module
without entering the module, etc
The second error is that the user gives an invalid value to the function, but it has a valid argument and
does not match the function. The third error is that any number divided by zero is not defined and has
no answer. An arithmetic operation or values whose size is greater than the defined size of each
variable, a series of values occurs. The sixth error: When we give a code to the interpreter, it parses it
and executes it. If the interpreter cannot parse, this error occurs and the invariant syntax is used. You
have made the seventh error, when we write a program in Python and divide the string by an integer,
such as one, this error may be given
16. Consider the following program which contains some errors. You may assume that the comments
within the program accurately describe the program’s intended behavior.
# Get two numbers from the user
n1 = float(input()) # 1
n2 = float(input()) # 2
# Compute sum of the two numbers
print(n1 + n2) # 3
# Compute average of the two numbers
print(n1+n2/2) # 4 => print ((n1+n2)/2)
# Assign some variables
d1 = d2 = 0 # 5
# Compute a quotient
print(n1/d1) # 6=> d1=0 –then zerodivisionError
# Compute a product
n1*n2 = d1 # 7=> we don’t know n1 and n2 so we are not sure result if
the result is 0 or not … n1 or n2 must be 0 to get 0 in the result .
.در نتیجه بدست بیاید 0باشد تا 0باید n2یا n1...است یا نه 0را نمی دانیم بنابراین مطمئن نیستیم که نتیجه n2و n1ما
# Print result
print(d1) # 8
For each line listed in the comments, indicate whether or not an interpreter error, run-time exception,
or logic error is present. Not all lines contain an error.
.که دلیل آنها در قسمت باال به طور کامل توضیح داده شده است ...در هر سه مورد اینگونه است <=خطا منطقی است نه مفسری *
* The error is logical, not interpretive => it is like this in all three cases... the reason for which is fully
explained in the above section.
17. Write the shortest way to express each of the following statements.
(a) x = x + 1 => x += 1
(b) x = x / 2 => x /= 2
(c) x = x – 1 => x -= 1
(d) x = x + y => x += y
(e) x = x - (y + 7) => x -= y + z
(f) x = 2*x => x *= 2
(g) number_of_closed_cases = number_of_closed_cases + 2*ncc =>number_of_closed_cases += 2*ncc
18. What is printed by the following code fragment?
x1 = 2
x2 = 2
x1 += 1
x2 -= 1
print(x1)
print(x2)
result => for : print(x1) -> 3 & for : print(x2) -> 1
Why does the output appear as it does?
چرا که قبل از اجرای دستور پرینت عملیات های محاسباتی روی آنها انجام میشود و جایگزین داده ها ی اولیه میشود و هنگام *
 .فراخوانی داده ها خروجی از داده های جدید استفاده میکند
* Because before executing the print command, calculation operations are performed on them and the
new data replaces the initial data, and it uses the new data when it is called and in the output.
19. Consider the following program that attempts to compute the circumference of a circle given the
radius entered by the user. Given a circle’s radius, r, the circle’s circumference, C is given by the formula:
 C = 2πr
r = 0
PI = 3.14159
# Formula for the area of a circle given its radius
r = float(input("Please enter the circle's radius: "))
C = 2*PI*r
# Get the radius from the user
#r = float(input("Please enter the circle's radius: "))
# Print the circumference
print("Circumference is", C)
(a) The program does not produce the intended result. Why?
اجرا میشود و پس از انجام عملیات از ما شعاع جدید را میخواهد که دیگر روی محاسبات تاثیری 0چون ابتدا دستور با شعاع *
.ندارد و هرعددی ضربدر صفر برابر صفر است
* Because first the command is executed with a radius of 0, and after performing the operation, it asks
us for the new radius, which no longer affects the calculations, and any number multiplied by zero is
equal to zero.
(b) How can it be repaired so that it works correctly?
.قرمز رنگ شده است و پاسخ درست با رنگ سبز در قسمت باال نوشته شده است (ایراد کد)خطا *
* The error (code error) is colored red and the correct answer is written in green at the top.
When this operator is placed between expressions, it adds them together.
Answer 20
import os
shutdown = input("Do you want to shutdown your computer (yes / no): ")
if shutdown == 'yes':
 os.system("shutdown /s /t 1")
else:
 print('Shutdown is not requested')
Answer 21
import calendar
year =int( input("Enter the year of the required calendar "))
month = int( input("Enter the month of the required calendar "))
print(calendar.month(year,
